#Android Studio App with Firebase Authentication
This is an Android Studio app that authenticates users on login and registration before accessing the services of the application. Authentication was done with Firebase, hence you might want to create a Google Firebase account for this.

The app authenticates users by prompting them to enter their first name, last name, username, password and email on registration. After registration, users will login with their username and password.
